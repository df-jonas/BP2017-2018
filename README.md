This thesis project ([`title`](https://title.com/)) is the result of a unique 
collaboration between two students of the courses Dig-X and Multec of the 
Erasmus University College Brussels and has been realized in the academic 
year 2017-2018.

[`title`](https://title.com/) is a platform developed by students for students 
to help them better understand their curriculum, this by enabling them to get 
summaries of courses, easily sharing their interests and get tutoring if needed.
The tutorship-system will be our main focus in this platform, to make it easy
for as well as tutor as tutee to give and get help with ease. Recommendations
based on grades can be provided with thanks to the Canvas platform.
